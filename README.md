so one day dado says why does so many malware exists? and dado asks hanster buisnuess parner, 'why dosen"t we do that'. and parner says okay so that we do not fall behind the compeptitiion.
and dado, as great entrepenuer and capitalist, he creat the funy monky malware only for sale at the supermarket and gas station for only the price of $2.75, or one carrot.
so this is funy monky malware, which is a malware that is very good because it put funy monke on computation device screen </span>
